# Into-the-Wild

Data entry, cleaning, visualization, and analysis for Santa Clara University's student run outdoors organization, Into the Wild. In this project, using data that I collected and entered, I create visualizations and utilize other techniques to analyze our organization's trip sales for both day hikes and overnight camping trips during the past school year. The questions I explore in this project include but are not limited to the following:

1. What are the most important factors that affect trip sign ups?
2. Are Friday overnights more popular/likely to fill than Saturday overnights?
3. How are trip sales affected by the quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring)?
4. What locations are in demand (trips we should run again) and which are not (trips we won't run again)?
5. How do sign up numbers vary with type of trip (car camping, backpacking, beach)?
